Hi Alex

I spoke with my collegue and we decided to give to you  pure JS/Angular/CSS/HTML test


So, please, if can render this page of old  version fo Viventor, and send us the code, could be a good test

We need the page, with all the formal test of the fields: email, password (more than 7 chars with number, letter and not-number chars), DNI/NIE, phone number (Spanish version) and drop down for countries and languages

We expect to have  the test done for the end of the week. Please give us the time you dedicated to do it

Thanks for your time in the interviews and to do the test
